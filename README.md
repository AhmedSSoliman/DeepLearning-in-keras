# DeepLearning-in-keras
Keras is a powerful and easy-to-use free open source Python library for developing and evaluating deep learning models.

It wraps the efficient numerical computation libraries Theano and TensorFlow and allows you to define and train neural network models in just a few lines of code.

# Steps:

    Load Data.
    Define Keras Model.
    Compile Keras Model.
    Fit Keras Model.
    Evaluate Keras Model.
    Make Predictions
